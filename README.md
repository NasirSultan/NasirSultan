### How I Use GitHub with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

</div>

I use GitHub as my version control and collaboration hub for all types of projects:

- **PHP** — I build scalable Laravel backends, push clean code using branches, and handle pull requests for reviewing logic and architecture.
- **JavaScript** — I develop dynamic interfaces using React, Vue, and vanilla JS, with commits structured around feature-based development.
- **HTML/CSS** — I craft responsive and accessible UI, organize code into component folders, and often use GitHub Actions for linting and deployment.

GitHub helps me track progress, collaborate with other developers, manage issues, and automate testing and CI/CD workflows across all tech stacks I use.
